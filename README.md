# Smart Brain (Face Recognition APP)

    HEADS UP! Sometimes the Clarifai Models can be down or not working as they are constantly getting updated. A good way to check if the model you are using is up, is to check  them on the Clarifai website. For example, for the Face Detect Mode: https://www.clarifai.com/models/face-detection. If that isn't working, then that means you will have to wait until their servers are back up.

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. You must add your own API key in the `src/App.js` file to connect to Clarifai.

You can grab Clarifai API key [here](https://www.clarifai.com/)
